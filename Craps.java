/* 

COMMENTS FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:

This is a pretty good version of the Craps game, Alex. It plays by the
rules of Craps, and you built in a clever little check of the "count"
variable to allow the second loop to run cleanly. That was a neat
idea!

Your version of this program doesn't appear to have the default (Y/n) 
feature included, which was given in the assignment handout. Also,
feel free to break this rather long program up into a few static 
methods to make it all a little more manageable, yes?

Otherwise, very nice work!

SCORE: 14/15
